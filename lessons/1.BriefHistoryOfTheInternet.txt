1. Beginning: 1960s - ARPANET
The foundations of the internet were laid in the 1960s with the ARPANET project developed by the US Department of Defenseâ€™s ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency).

The goal was to connect different computers via networks to enable data sharing.

In 1969, ARPANET first connected four universities.

2. Development of Protocols: 1970s - TCP/IP
In the 1970s, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the TCP/IP protocol to allow communication between different networks.

In 1983, ARPANET officially adopted the TCP/IP protocol, which became the fundamental protocol of the internet.

3. Expansion of the Internet: 1980s - Domain Name System (DNS)
The DNS system was established in 1983, allowing the use of domain names instead of IP addresses.

By the late 1980s, many universities and research centers connected to the internet.

4. Birth of the World Wide Web: 1990
Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web (WWW) system at CERN in 1990.

The first website and web browser were made available in 1991.

WWW made the internet graphical and user-friendly.

5. Commercial and Public Expansion: 1990s
From the mid-1990s, the internet started being used for commercial purposes and by the general public.

Web browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer became popular.

Services such as email, online shopping, and social media developed.

6. Today
Today, the internet is a global network connecting billions of devices.

It is rapidly evolving with technologies like mobile internet, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and 5G.
