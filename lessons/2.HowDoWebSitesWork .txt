How Does a Website Work?
1. User Request
The user types a website address (URL) into a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) or clicks a link.

The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server associated with that URL.

2. DNS Lookup
The browser queries the DNS (Domain Name System) server to translate the domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into an IP address that computers can understand (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

3. Connecting to the Server
Using the IP address from DNS, the browser connects to the web server and sends the HTTP request specifying which page or file it wants (like index.html).

4. Server Processes the Request
The web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) receives the request and finds the requested file or data.

If the content is dynamic (using PHP, Node.js, Python, etc.), the server processes the request and generates HTML as a response.

5. Sending the Response
The server sends back the requested HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and other media (images, videos) as an HTTP response to the browser.

6. Browser Processes the Data
The browser receives and parses the HTML file.

It downloads and applies the CSS and JavaScript files referenced in the HTML.

The page is rendered visually and functionally for the user.

7. Interaction and Additional Requests
The user can interact with the page (click buttons, fill forms, scroll).

These interactions may trigger new HTTP requests (e.g., API calls to load more data).

This makes the website interactive.
