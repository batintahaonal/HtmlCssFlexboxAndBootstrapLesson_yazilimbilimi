What is CSS?
CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style language used to define the appearance and design of web pages.

Key features of CSS:
It controls the colors, fonts, sizes, layout, backgrounds, and more of the page created with HTML.

It makes web pages look more beautiful, readable, and user-friendly.

With CSS, you can apply styles defined in one file to many elements on the page easily.

The term “Cascading” means that different styles are applied in a hierarchical order, deciding which styles take precedence.
